# Generic-API
A generic API made with Node.js

# Why?
This API is built so everytime you need a quick and simple Node.js API, you can just fork this and customize it.

# What is it built with?
Knex and Express, mostly. You can check the other packages in the package.json file, but it is mostly really simple.

# How do I start it?

Just clone it, and run:
```
npm i
npm start
```
After that, create a Mysql database and configure the knex-config.js file.
