# Generic-API
A generic API made with Node.js

# What is its purpose?
This API is built so everytime you need a quick and simple Node.js API, you can just fork this and customize it.

# What is it built with?
Knex and Express, mostly. You can check the other packages in the **package.json** file, but it is mostly really simple.

# How do I start it?

Just clone it, and run:
```
npm i
npm start
```
After that, create database and configure the **knex-config.js** file.
The application will be running on `http://localhost:4100`.
